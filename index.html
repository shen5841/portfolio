                    <p>I'm Felix Shen, a current 10th grader at Dublin High School. I'm currently enrolled in Introduction to Engineering Design class, and I loves to do design, build  on the daily basis, and also code in my spare time. Ever Since my Freshman year taking CSE, and joining the robotics club, I've went from not knowing my potential career path, to having a clear picture of me wanting to pursue the engineering path. 
                    At school, I always tried my best to stay engaged in my classes, and always do my best on my class assignments, and homeworks. Outside of school, I also spend my time on robotics and violin.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently in the Dublin High School orchestra as a concertmaster, where I run sectionals to tutor other people about the different skills regarding to the violin, and the music. During my own time, I like to practice violin regularly, and have been playing since 5 years old. 
                    I have participated in many local, and national violin competitions when I was in Taiwan, and I have also spent time working with different repertoires on my own, and in different orchestras outside of school. </p>
                    <p>I'm also a very dedicated robotics member currently on X team, and I spent around 3 hours on average, for 3 times a day for our team meetings as being one of the builder, and programmer. 
                    During my time in robotics club, we've went around the whole bay area to participate in different local tournaments, and compete with other robotics teams. Throughout the competitive process in local competitions, it allows me to learn the values of teamwork, and the ability to manage my time, and the different skills in building, and programming the robot. 
                    I've joined the robotics club ever since my Freshman year, and our teams have won numerous awards from local competitions, and some bigger awards including the Create Award that qualified our W team to worlds during the 2016-2017 season, and also Design Award that qualified our X team to States during the 2017-2018 season. 
                    In my spare time, I also like to apply my programming skills from working with robotics, and the Computer Software Engineering class that I took in Freshman year, and apply it into making my own games, and applications. </p>
